# 2. String Manipulation - Anagram Check (Java)
This project contains a Java program that determines whether two input strings are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are strings that contain the same characters, but in a different order.

## Description

The `AnagramCheck.java` file contains a Java program that:

1.  Takes two strings as input.
2.  Checks if the lengths of the strings are equal. If not, they cannot be anagrams.
3.  Converts the strings to character arrays.
4.  Sorts both character arrays.
5.  Compares the sorted arrays. If they are equal, the strings are anagrams.

## Files

* `AnagramCheck.java`: The Java source code file.

## Usage

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2.  **Compilation:**
    * Open a terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the directory containing `AnagramCheck.java`.
    * Compile the program using the command: `javac AnagramCheck.java`
3.  **Execution:**
    * Run the compiled program using the command: `java AnagramCheck`
    * The program will execute and output whether the test strings within the main method are anagrams. You can modify the strings within the main method of the java file to test other strings.
